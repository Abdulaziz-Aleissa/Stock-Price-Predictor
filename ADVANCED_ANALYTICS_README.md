## 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulations

### Overview
Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful mathematical technique that uses random sampling to model the probability of different outcomes in complex systems. In finance, it helps quantify investment risks and potential returns by running thousands of hypothetical market scenarios.

### How It Works

#### Core Methodology
1. **Historical Analysis**: Analyzes past stock price movements and volatility patterns
2. **Random Path Generation**: Creates thousands of possible future price paths using statistical properties
3. **Risk Assessment**: Calculates probability distributions of potential gains and losses
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Provides confidence intervals and risk metrics

#### Mathematical Foundation
The simulation uses geometric Brownian motion to model stock prices:

```
S(t+Δt) = S(t) × exp((μ - σ²/2)Δt + σ√Δt × Z)
```

Where:
- `S(t)` = Stock price at time t
- `μ` = Expected return (drift)
- `σ` = Volatility
- `Z` = Random number from standard normal distribution
- `Δt` = Time increment

### Practical Applications

## ⚠️ Value at Risk (VaR)

### Overview
Value at Risk quantifies the maximum potential loss in a portfolio over a specific time period at a given confidence level. It's a fundamental risk management tool used by banks, hedge funds, and institutional investors worldwide.

### How It Works

#### Core Concept
VaR answers the question: "What is the worst case loss we might expect over N days with X% confidence?"

For example: "There is a 5% chance we will lose more than $10,000 over the next 10 days"

#### VaR Calculation Methods

##### 1. Historical VaR (Non-Parametric)
Uses actual historical price movements without distributional assumptions.

**Process:**
1. Collect historical returns (typically 252-500 days)
2. Sort returns from worst to best
3. Find the percentile corresponding to confidence level
4. Scale for holding period and portfolio value

**Advantages:**
- No distributional assumptions
- Captures actual market behavior
- Simple to understand and implement

**Limitations:**
- Assumes future resembles past
- Limited by historical data availability
- May not capture structural changes

##### 2. Parametric VaR (Normal Distribution)
Assumes returns follow a normal distribution.

**Formula:**
```
VaR = Portfolio Value × (μ - σ × Z) × √T
```

Where:
- `μ` = Expected return
- `σ` = Standard deviation of returns
- `Z` = Normal distribution critical value (1.645 for 95% confidence)
- `T` = Time horizon in days

**Advantages:**
- Quick calculation
- Smooth estimates
- Well-understood statistical properties

**Limitations:**
- Assumes normal distribution (often violated)
- Underestimates tail risks
- Poor performance during market stress

##### 3. Monte Carlo VaR
Uses simulation to generate potential portfolio values.

**Process:**
1. Model return distributions (potentially non-normal)
2. Run thousands of simulations
3. Calculate portfolio values for each simulation
4. Determine VaR from simulation results

**Advantages:**
- Flexible distributional assumptions
- Handles complex portfolios
- Captures non-linear relationships

**Limitations:**
- Computationally intensive
- Model risk (garbage in, garbage out)
- Requires careful parameter estimation

### Advanced Risk Measures

#### Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR)
Average loss beyond the VaR threshold - provides insight into tail risk.

**Formula:**
```
ES = E[Loss | Loss > VaR]
```

**Benefits:**
- Coherent risk measure (mathematically superior)
- Better for portfolio optimization
- Provides full tail risk picture

#### Risk Decomposition
Understanding sources of portfolio risk:

- **Component VaR**: Each asset's contribution to total VaR
- **Marginal VaR**: Risk added by small position increases
- **Incremental VaR**: Risk change from adding new positions

### Practical Implementation

#### Portfolio VaR Calculation
For multi-asset portfolios, considers:
- Individual asset volatilities
- Correlation between assets
- Position sizes and weights
- Currency exposures (if applicable)

**Correlation Matrix Impact:**
Higher correlations increase portfolio VaR (diversification benefits decrease)

#### Stress Testing
VaR limitations require complementary stress tests:
- **Historical Scenarios**: 2008 Financial Crisis, COVID-19 crash
- **Hypothetical Scenarios**: Interest rate shocks, market crashes
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Key variable changes (volatility, correlations)

### Risk Management Applications

#### Position Sizing
Determine optimal trade sizes based on:
- Risk tolerance (maximum acceptable loss)
- VaR estimates
- Portfolio concentration limits

#### Risk Budgeting
Allocate risk across:
- Asset classes
- Geographic regions
- Individual strategies
- Time horizons

#### Performance Evaluation
Risk-adjusted metrics:
- **Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC)**
- **Sharpe Ratio enhancement**
- **Maximum risk utilization efficiency**

### Example Analysis
```
Portfolio: Diversified US Equity ($100,000)
Holding Period: 10 days
Confidence Level: 95%

VaR Results:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Method          │ VaR ($)     │ VaR (%)     │
├─────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Historical      │ $4,250      │ 4.25%       │
│ Parametric      │ $3,890      │ 3.89%       │
│ Monte Carlo     │ $4,180      │ 4.18%       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

Expected Shortfall (95%): $6,200 (6.2%)
Maximum Historical Loss: $8,500 (8.5%)

Risk Assessment: MODERATE
- VaR levels within acceptable range
- Strong diversification benefits
- Consider position size limits
```

## 📊 Time Series Forecasting

### Overview
Time series forecasting analyzes sequential data points to predict future values. In finance, it's used to forecast stock prices, volatility, and market trends using sophisticated mathematical models like ARIMA and GARCH.

### Mathematical Foundation

#### ARIMA Models (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

ARIMA models capture different aspects of time series behavior:

##### AutoRegressive (AR) Component
Current value depends on its own past values:
```
X(t) = c + φ₁X(t-1) + φ₂X(t-2) + ... + φₚX(t-p) + ε(t)
```

##### Integrated (I) Component
Differencing to achieve stationarity:
```
ΔX(t) = X(t) - X(t-1)
```
May require multiple differencing: ΔΔX(t) = ΔX(t) - ΔX(t-1)

##### Moving Average (MA) Component
Current value depends on past forecast errors:
```
X(t) = μ + ε(t) + θ₁ε(t-1) + θ₂ε(t-2) + ... + θₑε(t-q)
```

##### Complete ARIMA(p,d,q) Model
```
(1 - φ₁L - φ₂L² - ... - φₚLᵖ)(1-L)ᵈX(t) = (1 + θ₁L + θ₂L² + ... + θₑLᵠ)ε(t)
```

Where L is the lag operator and ε(t) is white noise.

### Model Selection Process

#### 1. Stationarity Testing
**Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test:**
- H₀: Series has unit root (non-stationary)
- H₁: Series is stationary
- If p-value < 0.05, reject H₀ (series is stationary)

#### 2. Parameter Identification
**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):**
- Measures correlation between observations at different lags
- Helps identify MA component order (q)

**Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):**
- Measures direct correlation controlling for intermediate lags
- Helps identify AR component order (p)

#### 3. Model Estimation
**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
Finds parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the data.

#### 4. Model Validation
**Information Criteria:**
- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**: Balances fit and complexity
- **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**: Penalizes complexity more heavily
- Lower values indicate better models

### GARCH Models (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)

#### Volatility Clustering
Financial returns exhibit:
- Periods of high volatility followed by high volatility
- Periods of low volatility followed by low volatility
- Fat tails (more extreme events than normal distribution predicts)

#### GARCH(p,q) Model Structure

**Return Equation:**
```
r(t) = μ + ε(t)
ε(t) = σ(t) × z(t)
```

**Volatility Equation:**
```
σ²(t) = ω + Σαᵢε²(t-i) + Σβⱼσ²(t-j)
```

Where:
- `r(t)` = Return at time t
- `σ²(t)` = Conditional variance (volatility²)
- `z(t)` = Standardized residual (usually normal or t-distributed)
- `ω, α, β` = Model parameters

#### Popular GARCH Variants

**GARCH(1,1) - Most Common:**
```
σ²(t) = ω + α₁ε²(t-1) + β₁σ²(t-1)
```

**EGARCH (Exponential GARCH):**
Captures asymmetric effects (bad news increases volatility more than good news)

**GJR-GARCH:**
Separate parameters for positive and negative shocks

### Forecasting Process

#### 1. Data Preparation
- **Price Data**: Collect historical closing prices
- **Return Calculation**: Convert to returns (percentage changes)
- **Stationarity Check**: Test and transform if necessary
- **Outlier Treatment**: Handle extreme values appropriately

#### 2. Model Fitting

**ARIMA for Returns:**
1. Test stationarity (ADF test)
2. Identify parameters using ACF/PACF
3. Estimate model parameters
4. Validate residuals (no autocorrelation)

**GARCH for Volatility:**
1. Fit ARIMA model for returns
2. Test residuals for ARCH effects
3. Fit GARCH model to residuals
4. Validate model adequacy

#### 3. Forecasting

**Point Forecasts:**
Single best estimate for future values

**Interval Forecasts:**
Range of values with specified confidence level

**Density Forecasts:**
Full probability distribution of future values

### Practical Applications

#### Price Forecasting
- **1-day ahead**: Short-term trading decisions
- **1-week ahead**: Swing trading strategies
- **1-month ahead**: Portfolio rebalancing
- **Quarterly**: Strategic asset allocation

#### Volatility Forecasting
- **Risk Management**: VaR calculations, position sizing
- **Options Pricing**: Volatility is key input for Black-Scholes
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Expected returns and risk estimates
- **Hedge Ratios**: Dynamic hedging strategies

#### Model Performance Evaluation

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: √(Σ(actual - forecast)²/n)
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Σ|actual - forecast|/n
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Σ|actual - forecast|/actual × 100/n

**Directional Accuracy:**
Percentage of times forecast correctly predicts direction of change

**Statistical Tests:**
- **Ljung-Box Test**: Residual autocorrelation
- **ARCH-LM Test**: Remaining heteroskedasticity
- **Jarque-Bera Test**: Normality of residuals

### Example Implementation

#### Stock Price Forecasting Workflow
```python
# 1. Data Collection
prices = get_stock_data("AAPL", period="2y")
returns = prices.pct_change().dropna()

# 2. Stationarity Test
adf_stat, p_value = adfuller(returns)
# If p_value > 0.05, difference the series

# 3. Model Selection
# Test various ARIMA(p,d,q) combinations
# Select based on AIC/BIC criteria

# 4. Model Fitting
model = ARIMA(returns, order=(1,0,1))
fitted_model = model.fit()

# 5. Forecasting
forecast = fitted_model.forecast(steps=30)
conf_int = fitted_model.get_forecast(steps=30).conf_int()

# 6. Volatility Modeling
residuals = fitted_model.resid
garch_model = arch_model(residuals, vol='GARCH', p=1, q=1)
garch_fitted = garch_model.fit()

# 7. Volatility Forecasting
vol_forecast = garch_fitted.forecast(horizon=30)
```

### Limitations and Considerations

#### Model Assumptions
- **Linear Relationships**: May miss non-linear patterns
- **Parameter Stability**: Assumes constant relationships over time
- **Normal Distributions**: Financial returns often have fat tails

#### Structural Breaks
- **Regime Changes**: Market conditions change over time
- **Event Impact**: Major events can break historical relationships
- **Solution**: Rolling estimation, regime-switching models

#### Forecasting Horizon
- **Short-term (1-5 days)**: Generally more accurate
- **Medium-term (1-4 weeks)**: Moderate accuracy
- **Long-term (>1 month)**: Limited accuracy, more uncertainty

### Best Practices

#### Model Development
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic ARIMA models
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Out-of-sample validation essential
3. **Regular Updates**: Re-estimate models periodically
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple model forecasts

#### Risk Management
1. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Always provide confidence intervals
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Consider multiple possible outcomes
3. **Model Monitoring**: Track forecast accuracy over time
4. **Human Oversight**: Models are tools, not replacements for judgment

#### Practical Implementation
1. **Computational Efficiency**: Balance accuracy with speed
2. **Real-time Updates**: Automated model re-fitting
3. **Integration**: Connect with trading and risk systems
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear model documentation
